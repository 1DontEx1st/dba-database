# dba-database

This is my DBA database that contains my utility scripts that I use to help manage my servers.

Some of this code was never intended to be used by anyone else--it's primarily here for myself, but if you want to use it, make sure you know exactly what it's doing before using any of this code.

Some of this code assumes that the First Responder Kit (firstresponderkit.org) and Ola Hallengren's maintenance code (ola.hallengren.com) are installed in the same database as well.
